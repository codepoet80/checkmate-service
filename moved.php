<h1>Check Mate has moved!</h1>
<p>Domain renewals were getting expensive, so this app has moved to a subdomain.</p>
<p>If you're using the web app, uninstall and re-install at the new address: <a href="https://checkmate.wosa.link">checkmate.wosa.link</a></p>
<p>If you're on webOS, get the new version of the app from the <a href="https://appcatalog.webosarchive.org">App Museum</a>!</p>
